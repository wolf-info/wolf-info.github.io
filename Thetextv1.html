  <h1><b>Wolves</b></h1><p>"The gray wolf or Canis lupus, also known as the timber wolf or western wolf, 
  is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America. 
  It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging 43–45 kg (95–99 lb) and 
  females 36–38.5 kg (79–85 lb). Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other Canis 
  species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. 
  Its winter fur is long and bushy and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly 
  pure white, red, and brown to black also occur. 
  As of 2005, 37 subspecies of Canis lupus are recognised by Mammal Species of the World.</p>
  <p>The gray wolf is the second most specialized member of the genus Canis, after the Ethiopian wolf, 
  as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey, 
  its more gregarious nature, and its highly advanced expressive behavior.
   It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species, such as the eastern wolf, coyote, and golden jackal
   to produce fertile hybrids. It is the only species of Canis to have a range encompassing both the Old and New Worlds,
   and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene, 
   colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean.
   It is a social animal, travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring.
   The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it.
   It feeds primarily on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.</p>
   <p>The gray wolf is one of the world's best-known and most-researched animals,
   with probably more books written about it than any other wildlife species. 
   It has a long history of association with humans, having been despised and 
   hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock, 
   while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. 
   Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies, the majority of 
   recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies.
   Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is rare,
   as wolves are relatively few, live away from people, 
   and have developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds."</p><b><i> From Wikipedia. Wikipedia, 5 July 17. Web. 5 July 2017. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf</a></i></b>
<h2>Family</h2>
   <p>Wolves belong to family groups called packs. These packs usually consist of between eight to fifteen members. Occasionally, however, a wolf can be driven out of the pack. This would most likely be the lowest member of a pack (the omega). This is popularly know as a "lone wolf". Rank order is established and maintained through a series of ritualized fights and posturing best described as ritual bluffing. Wolves prefer psychological warfare to physical confrontations, meaning that high-ranking status is based more on personality or attitude than on size or physical strength. Rank, who holds it, and how it is enforced varies widely between packs and between individual animals. In large packs full of easygoing wolves, or in a group of juvenile wolves, rank order may shift almost constantly, or even be circular (e.g., animal A dominates animal B, who dominates animal C, who dominates animal A).

</p>
   <ul>Among pack-living wolves, alpha wolves are the genetic parents of most cubs in the pack. Wolves show deference to the alpha pair in their pack by allowing them to be the first to eat and, usually, the only pair to reproduce.</ul>
   <ul>Beta wolves - a "second-in-command".</ul>
   <ul>There is usually one wolf belonging in the lowest rank, the omega.</ul>
